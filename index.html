                    <article>
                        <p>
                        I’m a U.S. Army veteran and a senior at the University of North Texas, pursuing a degree in 
                        <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        During my time in the military, I served as a <strong>Geospatial Intelligence Analyst</strong>, 
                        gaining hands-on experience with geospatial technologies in high-stakes intelligence operations, 
                        including a <strong>24/7 ISR mission in South Korea</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Since transitioning to full-time studies and the <strong>Army Reserve</strong>, I’ve focused on broadening 
                        my technical skill set both academically and independently. My coursework has emphasized programming in 
                        <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, and I’m most comfortable working in 
                        <strong>C++</strong>. Beyond my classes, I’ve also explored <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, 
                        and <strong>JavaScript</strong> through self-directed learning on platforms like Codecademy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        I’m passionate about continuous learning and growth as a software developer. This website serves as a place 
                        to <strong>showcase my projects, skills, and progress</strong> as I continue to develop as both a student and a professional.
